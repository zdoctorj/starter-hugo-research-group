Dr Rong Wang is a Full Professor and President’s Chair in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. She also holds the position of Director, Singapore Membrane Technology Centre (SMTC). She is the founding President of Membrane Society in Singapore (MEMSIS).

Dr Wang received her Bachelor degree from Zhejiang University, China in 1984 and PhD degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1992. She worked at the Institute of Process Engineering, CAS as Assistant Professor/Associate Professor (1992-1999). She was a Senior Research Scientist/Deputy Centre Director/Centre Director at the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering, Singapore (1999-2008). She joined NTU in 2008 as Associate Professor, and was promoted to Full Professor in 2014. She served as the Chair of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at NTU from 2014 to 2020. Dr Wang also assisted Dr Tony Fane in setting up Singapore Membrane Technology Centre (SMTC) in 2008 as Deputy Director, and becomes Director of SMTC since 2012. She serves as an Editor of Journal of Membrane Science (JMS) since 2014 and became Editor-in-Chief of JMS in 2020. She is on the editorial board of Desalination since 2011.

Dr Wang has over 30 years of experience in Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Water and Energy related research and innovation. She specializes in novel membrane development for water and wastewater treatment, liquid purification and gas separation, and in the development of novel hybrid membrane systems and process simulation.

Dr Wang has over 280 SCI tracked journal publications (cited times: >15,000, h-index: 69 @Web of Science as June 2020). She is the inventor of 24 patents/ technical disclosures for novel membrane fabrication. One patent led to the setup of a spin-off company, Aquaporin Asia, in 2011 for biomimetic membrane commercialization. Another spin-off company, Aromatec Pte Ltd, was formed in 2018 based on the forward osmosis (FO) membrane technology developed by her team. The third spin-off company, MEM+ Technology Pte Ltd, was set up in Feb 2020 based on her invention of bio-programmable hollow fiber reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes.

Dr Wang was featured among the top 25 leading water researchers globally by Lux Research in 2013, and was the winner of Singapore’s Minister for National Development R&D Award in 2013. She received a prestigious “Alternative Water Prize” from Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water (PSIPW) from Saudi Arabia in 2016, and was awarded Nanyang Research Award in 2018. She was appointed to President’s Chair in Civil and Environmental Engineering at NTU in 2019. She became a Fellow of the Academy of Engineering Singapore in 2020.
