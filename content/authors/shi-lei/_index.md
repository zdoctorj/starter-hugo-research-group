Dr. Shi Lei has more than 10 years of extensive experience and knowledge in novel hollow fiber membrane development for water purification and treatment. During his many years in R&D, he has published over 20 SCI-tracked journal publications and co-invented 6 patents/technical disclosures related to novel membrane fabrication. He was the most senior member of the research team led by Professor Wang Rong at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The research team was the first in the world to develop “Thin-Film-Composite Forwards Osmosis Hollow Fiber Membranes” in 2010, and the team’s research achievements became renowned worldwide, for being at the forefront of Forward Osmosis technology development. The first leading-edge paper published by the team was even ranked among the top 25 most cited papers in the “Journal of Membrane Science” published since 2009.

Dr. Shi led and participated in 6 major research projects, funded by government grants, as well as industrial sponsorships, covering various membrane-based technology research, including Membrane Contactor, Membrane Distillation, Forward Osmosis, Pressure Retard Osmosis and Low Pressure Nanofiltration. In 2013, he won the first prize at the “Prosper.Net-Scopus Young Scientist Award in Sustainability Development 2013”, and was offered the Prestigious Fellowship award by the Alexander Von Humbolt Foundation. This award is presented annually to young scientists or researchers, based in the Asia-Pacific region, who have made significant contributions in the area of Sustainable Development.
