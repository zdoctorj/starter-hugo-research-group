abstract: This study examined the feasibility and performance of a
  nanochannel-based biomimetic membrane (NBM) for brackish reverse osmosis (RO)
  desalination. Two types of peptide-attached synthetic nanochannels,
  (pR)-pillar [5]arenes (pRPH) and (pS)-pillar[5]arenes (pSPH), were
  incorporated into liposomes. pSPH is a diastereomer of pRPH and was used as a
  negative control (i.e. mutant) to pRPH in this work. The
  nanochannel-containing liposomes (e.g. pRPH-liposomes) were then immobilized
  into the active layer of the RO membranes via in situ interfacial
  polymerization on the top of a polysulfone support membrane to form NBM-pRPH
  membranes. To maximize the potential and benefits of the NBM-pRPH membrane,
  the physical characteristics of the polyamide layer was further tuned using
  some additives and the eventual membrane was named as NBM-pRPH-A. The
  NBMpRPH-A membrane exhibited a water permeability of 6.09 L m-2 h-1 bar- 1 and
  98.2% NaCl rejection under a 15.5 bar applied pressure using 2000 mg L-1 as
  feed solution. The 62% flux increment with respect to the pristine control is
  postulated to arise from a thinner, less cross-linked (more free volume) and
  more hydrophilic active layer as well as the possible supplementary transport
  pathways of the pRPH-liposomes. The performance of the NBMs under differential
  feed pressures and temperatures further exemplifies the water permeation
  property of the pRPH nanochannels. Accordingly, the NBM-pRPH-A gave a water
  permeability higher than commercial RO membranes tested in this work (DuPont
  BW30 and Hydranautics ESPA2) as well as other RO membranes reported in the
  literature. This study provides a tangible foundation for the development of
  NBMs for brackish RO desalination.
