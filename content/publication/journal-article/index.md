abstract: "In this study, a prototype microgranular adsorptive filtration (?GAF)
  system was constructed employing a 7-bore ceramic membrane as the primary
  membrane and either heated aluminum oxide particles (HAOPs) or powdered
  activated carbon (PAC) as the pre-deposited dynamic membrane (DM). The system
  was used to pre-treat membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent from a full-scale
  MBR-reverse osmosis (RO) water reclamation plant. The downstream RO
  performance and membrane fouling potential of the treated effluent were then
  assessed. The results indicated that: (i) although PAC removed more overall
  EfOM than HAOPs did, HAOPs were more effective in removing biopolymers such as
  polysaccharides and proteins, (ii) HAOPs virtually eliminated fouling of the
  primary ceramic membrane, whereas considerable fouling (much of it
  irreversible) occurred when the feed was pretreated with PAC, (iii) HAOPs
  removed more than 90% of the phosphorus and fluoride from the feed, but PAC
  removed negligible amounts of these contaminants, and (iv) HAOPs-treated
  effluent resulted in only a 43% decline in RO permeate water flux over 5 d of
  continuous filtration, as opposed to 62% flux decline for untreated or
  PAC-treated effluent. This study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of the
  HAOPs-based ?GAF process as a pre-treatment for improving downstream RO
  recovery."
