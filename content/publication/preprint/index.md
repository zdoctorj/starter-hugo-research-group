abstract: Membrane fouling persists to be among key obstacles in liquid
  membrane-based separation processes, and thereby the underlying understanding
  has actively been pursued. The two gaps attempted to be addressed here are
  namely, (i) internal fouling, which has limited studies due to limitations of
  instruments available; and (ii) fouling by mixtures of oppositely charged
  particles, as an extension to the studies on effect of surface charge of pure
  foulants on fouling. With the sub-micron pure constituents (namely, negatively
  charged carboxylated latex particles and positively charged aminated latex
  particles) as benchmarks, mixtures of three different compositions of the two
  particle types were investigated. The membrane was polycarbonate track-etched
  (PCTE) membrane. Surprisingly, the mixtures gave worse flux decline than that
  by purely positively charged aminated latex, which contradicts electrostatic
  considerations. The fouling model indicates that the mixtures exhibited higher
  pore blockage parameters (a) than either of the pure constituents, which agree
  with the flux decline trends. On the other hand, the mixtures gave internal
  cake resistance parameters (R c /R m ) in between that of the pure
  constituents, which disagree with the fouling trends. Furthermore, optical
  coherence tomography (OCT) analysis indicates that the mixtures had taller
  buildups on the membrane as well as heterogenous internal cakes. Therefore,
  the steepest flux declines for the mixtures seem to be better correlated with
  the extensive external fouling as manifested in the taller buildups on the
  membrane pores, rather than internal fouling since the internal cakes were
  more porous. The contradictory extensive external and mitigated internal
  fouling phenomena are unexpected based on electrostatic considerations, and
  thereby highlight that fouling resulting from mixtures may not be readily
  extrapolated from understanding based on pure particle feeds.
